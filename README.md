# Clubbing_DataBase_Management_System
This project aims at forging a Database Management System, which can be used by Clubs for a smooth handling of customers and their backend tasks.

This project was done by a pair of students. We initially looked at what could be the need for such a system, documenting it all in the Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) document, and then gathered mock and actual data on how this could help clubs.

This was followed by preparing an E-R diagram for the system, which helped us visualize the functionalities that we were supposed to implement.

Using Data Definition Language (DDL), entire database was created in PostGRESQL, which was then filled with mock data. A few queries were then run on the system to check its efficiency.
